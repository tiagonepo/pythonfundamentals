# Exercise: `all_lines`
1. Write a function, `all_lines`, which will take:
    - One mandatory argument, a filename, into which we'll write all of our output
    - Any number of filenames (strings), from which we'll read our input
2. Go through each line of each input file, and read from it one line at a time, and write those lines to the output file.
3. If you have problems reading from one or more files, put those errors into a dict. The function should return the dict, in which the problematic filenames are the keys and the exception text (which you can get with `str(e)`) is the values.
This means that if you give 10 filenames, and 5 give you trouble, then the output file will contain input from 5 files, and the function will return a dict with 5 key-value pairs, where the keys are the problematic filenames.
