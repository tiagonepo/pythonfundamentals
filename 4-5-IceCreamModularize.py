# Exercise: Modularize our ice cream
1. Keep the definitions of `Scoop` and `Bowl` in `icecream.py`.
2. Move all of the other code into a separate file, `eaticecream.py`.
3. You should be able to run `eaticecream.py`, and get the same results as we do now, with our single file -- but now, `icecream.py` is a module, which we can (in theory) use from other programs, too.
